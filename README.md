I am open to work & support. If you want something made for you, or you are having a GLUA related issue, I am approachable and willing to help (provided your problem can't be solved by google.)

I do not charge for support, however I have an apartment & utilities to pay for, a needy girlfriend to buy things for, and require food to make things. I am not free unless it is something incredibly simple.

I don't do exclusivity, I am willing to contract for a duration for continued support & project development as well will support anything I make for you for free, however unless stated otherwise I am always available.


I am available to contact on Discord: ZeMysticalTaco#1104 message me and I will get back to you within a maximum of 3 days.
